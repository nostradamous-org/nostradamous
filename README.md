# Nostradamos

Nostradamus is a platform that tries to provide a super application to users to get a feature like bridge, stack, and adding liquidity. This application is implemented on the Axelar Cross-chain platform.
Users only need to select the chain on which their asset is located and enter the amount. Then we will prepare them with the different ways of acquiring money on various chains with their details, and the users can easily select their desired option with a few clicks.
